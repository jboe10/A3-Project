TODOs:
Feel free to add items as things come up or refactoring/splitting is necessary.

Try not to delete items, rather one should mark it as cancelled.

    [ ] - Not started
          * TODO not started past initial documentation or stubs.

    [/] - In Progress
          * TODO in progress, some or all code is done, but bugs still may remain. If code is undocumented, it must be documented before reaching Finished status.

    [x] - Finished
          * Code is complete, documented, free of known bugs.

    [%] - Issue (specify underneath)
          * Some sort of miscellaneous issue with the TODO, specify underneath as best you can

    [$] - Cancelled
          * TODO cancelled, adding a reason will help remember why it was cancelled in the first place.

These tasks must be done to consider being a working version. Try to make these short and document stubs in code to explain structure, etc.

    [1] - High priority, detrimental to program function
    [2] - Moderate priority, potentially affects program function in certain circumstances.
